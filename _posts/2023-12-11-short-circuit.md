ðŸš€ ASP.NET Core #news - Short-circuit

Short-circuit is a new feature in ASP.NET Core 8.0 that allows you to skip the entire request pipeline and return a response directly from the endpoint. This feature is useful when you want to return a response without executing the rest of the pipeline. For example, endpoints like `/health`, `/favicon.ico`, or `/robots.txt` can be implemented using this feature.
