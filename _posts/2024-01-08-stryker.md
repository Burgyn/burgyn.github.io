ðŸ’¡ #unittest #tip - Test your tests with #stryker

How do you verify the quality of your unit tests? Do you use code coverage metrics or something else? 
A good way to verify the quality of your tests is to use mutation tests. 

ðŸ§Ÿ In mutation tests, you create mutations (defects) in your code. You run your tests against these changes and see if any mutations remain undetected (if they survived). 
âœ¨ To avoid having to do this manually, there is a framework called Stryker.NET that helps you do this.
