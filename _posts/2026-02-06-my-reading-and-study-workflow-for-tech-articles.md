I thought I'd share my flow for collecting and reading articles. Maybe you'll find it useful, or maybe you'll share yours in the comments.

🔍 Where I find articles
I usually discover interesting content in 4 places:

📬 [Marián Vlčák aka vlko's monthly newsletter](https://vlko.substack.com/)
Consistently high-quality tech content.

📰 Medium newsletter - Though lately it's been flooded with "5 things every .NET developer must know" type articles. You have to dig deeper to find the gems.

💼 LinkedIn - Still a solid source for technical articles. After Twitter's decline, it became even more valuable.

☁️ BlueSky - For me, the best Twitter replacement. I've created a custom feed built as a filter over my list of specific people I want to follow. BlueSky's killer feature is the ability to create your own feeds and have full control over what you see and how much.

🎙️ Podcasts - Another source where I often discover interesting topics to explore further.

📚 My reading workflow
When I find an interesting article, I don't read it immediately. Instead, I bookmark it using raindrop.io - my go-to bookmarking system for everything.
Articles I want to read go into a "Blogs" folder, which I've set up as a public RSS feed. This RSS feed is connected to Instapaper - a reader that creates a clean copy of the article, optimizes it for mobile reading, and most importantly: preserves scroll position. Whenever I return to an article, I'm exactly where I left off.

🤔 Why this seemingly complex setup?
I separate two activities:
 ⚡ Discovery - scrolling feeds and finding new content
 📖 Deep reading - actually consuming the content

My BlueSky feed is limited to max 20 posts per day. I quickly scan what interests me and save it for later. When I'm in the mood for reading, I open Instapaper. Raindrop keeps all my bookmarks organized in one place.
What's your workflow for managing technical articles? Do you read immediately or save for later?
