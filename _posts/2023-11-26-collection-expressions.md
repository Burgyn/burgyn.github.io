ðŸš€ #csharp 12 - #collectionexpressions

I have been developing in .NET for over 16 years, but even now I struggle when I have to create and initialize a simple array. Historically it has been a bit complicated. The new way of initializing with Collection expressions will bring C# closer to languages like Python, which have been more comfortable for this kind of data handling.
