How do you draw UML diagrams or charts? Do you draw? Not really, but sometimes it comes in handy and it's nice to have the some part of the system described with a sequence diagram, for example. 
In the past I used [draw.io](https://draw.io). Cool tool, but there was a standard problem with it. How to store the diagrams? How to add them to the documentation? How to share them? And the biggest problem how to edit them afterwards ðŸ¤”? 
I used [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) a couple of times, which solved exactly this. I simply create the diagram using text directly in markdown, and the tool renders the outline for me at that point. For me it's a great solution. 

However, I discovered [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/). Same idea, but given where and how it's integrated everywhere, it's a significantly better choice for me.

[Plugin for ChatGPT](https://docs.mermaidchart.com/plugins/mermaid-chart-gpt). I created the diagram above with a simple prompt to ChatGPT:

> I'm going to post an article just about Mermaid. Create me some interesting sequence diagram on how to write such a blog post. I'm writing the ideas in Notion, posting the post on blog.burgyn.online and blog.vyvojari.dev. I then do a social media post about it.
