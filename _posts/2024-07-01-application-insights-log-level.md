ðŸ¤¦ I've been using ApplicationInsights for a few years now, but only now have I had a real need to look for my own custom logs there. It took me a while to figure out why I can't find them there.

ðŸ¤” It's not enough to set the generic "LogLeve:Default" to "Information" (Debug, Trace), because by default the ApplicationInsights provider only pushes logs with severity Warning and higher to AppInsights anyway.

ðŸ’¡ In order to push them there you need to explicitly set "ApplicationInsights:LogLevel:Default:" to "Information" (Debug, Trace).

ðŸ¤ž Maybe this will help you sometime too.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information"
    },
    // ðŸ‘‡ This section is important
    "ApplicationInsights": {
      "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Information"
      }
    }
  },
  "ApplicationInsights": {
    "ConnectionString": ""
  }
}
```
