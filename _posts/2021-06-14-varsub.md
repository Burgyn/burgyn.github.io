To variable substitution in `json` files, we used the `FileTransform` task in our CD pipelines. Unfortunately, it does not allow you to process multiple `.zip` files at once. (Although it supports GLOB pattern, but the result of the pattern must be exactly one file)

This is very important to us. And that's why the `varsub` dotnet tool was created.

It is a dotnet tool, so it can be installed as follows:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g Kros.VariableSubstitution
```

If you want to replace the variables in the `json` file with environment variables, you can do so with a simple command:

```bash
varsub -w d:\Projects\artifacts -j **/appsettings.json
```

You can find more information about the parameters directly in the repository.
